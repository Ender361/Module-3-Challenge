# Module-3-Challenge
Module 3 Challenge for UW Bootcamp

This project is a website made with html, css, and javascript. The primary function of this website is to create a password randomly generated based on criteria input
by the user. The javascript uses multiple functions to: generate prompts and get proper password criteria preferences from user unput, create a randomized password
using the criteria varaibles collected by the user, to print the randomized password to the screen, and to do all of this only after the "generate password" button is
clicked.
